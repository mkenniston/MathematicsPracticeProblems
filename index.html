<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
No frills, no flashy web graphics, no ads: just solid math material.
Here you can find mathematics
problems &#8212; over 6,000 of them &#8212; that will provide as much practice
as anyone might ever need.
<p>
These problems are intended for teachers and students
in public or private
schools, homeschoolers, or independent learners of any age.
They are <em>not</em> tied to any particular textbook or teaching paradigm.
They do <em>not</em> contain any explanations of how to do the problems;
I leave that to you as the teacher.  These are simply raw material to
integrate into your lesson plan as you see fit.
<p>
The most obvious use of these problems
is for classroom work or homework assignments,
but they can also make it very easy for you to provide supplemental
material to individual students who need extra practice.
<p>
Technically these PDF files are copyrighted, but that is
to protect <em>your</em>
right to use them, not to allow me to profit from them.
You are free to print them, copy them, edit them, and distribute them as
you wish, so long as you don't charge for them.  I'm giving them to you
for free, so when you give them to others it also has to be for free.
Of course if your school charges tuition or fees that's fine, but you are not
allowed to package these problems up into a book and sell it.

<h2><a name="about">About the Problems</a></h2>
<p>
The problems are divided into sets.  Each set covers a single topic,
so you can select exactly the ones that you or your students need practice
with.
Within a topic, there are often multiple sets (e.g. A, B, C) which are of
gradually increasing difficulty so that you can select the level which is
most appropriate for your students.
<p>
To keep things as simple as possible, each set of problems is provided as
a single PDF file that contains both the problems and the answers.
You can download the file(s) you want by right-clicking on the filename
and selecting "Save&nbsp;Link&nbsp;As..." or the equivalent on your system.
Since these files are fairly large (typically hundreds of problems in each
one), you are not expected to print the whole file.  Instead, you can use
the printing dialog on your system (Windows, Mac, or Linux should all
work fine) to select which pages you want.  For example:
<ul>
<li>If you just want to assign a few homework problems to your students,
print 30 copies of the first page.
<li>If you want to assign different problems to each student, print
one copy each of the first 30 pages.
<li>If the page has too many problems, assign the first 5 or the last 10
or the even-numbered ones.
<li>If you don't want to give the answers to the students, don't print
the answer pages (at the end of the file), or print one copy for yourself.
</ul>
<p>
You will notice that the coverage of topics here is far from complete.
That's because I do this in my spare time, as a hobby, and receive no
compensation for it.  The focus is on quality rather than quantity.
But hey, they're free, right?
I do expect the coverage to increase slowly over time, and I do
accept suggestions on which topics would be most useful to add next;
please email them to me at <a href="mailto:mike@MathematicsPracticeProblems.com">mike@MathematicsPracticeProblems.com</a>.
<p>
The problems themselves are generated by computer programs, which is why
I can provide so many problems in each set without spending my whole
life doing this.
Because everything is
generated automatically there should never be an issue of occasional random
errors or typos, but of course there could still be bugs in the program.
If you do find any errors, please email me about them so I can fix them.
(Please specify the filename and problem number, and what the error is.)
If you want to see the actual Ruby code that generates the problems,
that's all open-source and is available under the GNU AGPL at
<a href="git://github.com/mkenniston/MathematicsPracticeProblems.git">git://github.com/mkenniston/MathematicsPracticeProblems.git</a>.
