Definitions of terms:
=====================

FormattedProblem:  A question + an answer, formatted for LaTeX.

Raw problem: A question + an answer, in internal list form
The exact list form varies by the type of problem.
The raw form is used primarily for testing.

Question:  The part of the problem that is presented to the
user.  It need not be literally phrased as a question, e.g. it could
be something like "solve for x".

Answer:  The part of the problem that is included in the answer key.

Problem type: A particular form of problem, e.g. "convert an improper
fraction to mixed form".

ProblemMaker:  A class which generates problems, all of the same type.
Different instances of a single class may generate different problem types
in a general family, e.g. a class that does fractions might generate
fractions with small, medium, or large numbers, or it might generate
both proper and improper fractions, all depending on the arguments to
its constructor.

Problem set: A series of many problems.  A set may contain only a single
problem type or it may contain many problem types.

ProblemSetMaker:  The class which generates problem sets.
When you create a ProblemSetMaker, you inject a list of ProblemMakers
which it uses.  Thus there is only one class, but each instance
of the class is customized for a particular problem set.
This is the class which actually writes the PDF files.
